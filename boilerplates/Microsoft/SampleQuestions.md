#### 1. Arrays / Strings (36% of questions, most frequent)

* Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. 
* Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. 
* Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid. The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where adjacent cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once. 
* Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer...Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space. 
* Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array where source[i] is the i-th line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character \n. 
* Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order. 
* Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm: Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars: If the group's length is 1, append the character to s. Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length. The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead be stored in the input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars. After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array. 
* Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters. 

### 2. Linked lists (29%)

* Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list. k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is. 
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null. Return a deep copy of the list. 
You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it. 
* Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed. 
Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order. Follow up: Can you sort the linked list in O(n logn) time and O(1) memory (i.e. constant space)? 


### 3. Graphs / Trees (20%)

* Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree. Note: You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree. 
Serialize and deserialize N-ary tree 
* Given a node in a binary search tree, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST. 
* Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST). 
* Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST. Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages: 1) Search for a node to remove. 2) If the node is found, delete the node. Follow up: can you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)? 
* Given a directed, acyclic graph of N nodes.  Find all possible paths from node 0 to node N-1, and return them in any order. The graph is given as follows:  the nodes are 0, 1, ..., graph.length - 1.  graph[i] is a list of all nodes j for which the edge (i, j) exists. 


### 4. Search / Sort (6%)

* Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water. 
You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children...Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL. Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL. 
* Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. 
* Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties: [1] Integers in each row are sorted from left to right. [2] The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row. 

### 5. Dynamic programming (5%)

* Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. 
* Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining. 
* Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'...The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial). 


### 6. Bit manipulation / Maths (4% of questions, least frequent)

* Given an array of strings arr. String s is a concatenation of a sub-sequence of arr which have unique characters. Return the maximum possible length of s. 
* Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
