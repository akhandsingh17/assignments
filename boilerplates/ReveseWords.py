"""
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words.
The returned string should only have a single space separating the words.
Do not include any extra spaces.

Example 1:
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
