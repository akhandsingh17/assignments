# Convert an array to reduced form | Set 1 (Simple and Hashing)
# Given an array with n distinct elements, convert the given array to a form where all elements are in range from 0 to n-1.
# The order of elements is same, i.e., 0 is placed in place of smallest element, 1 is placed for second smallest element, â€¦ n-1 is placed for largest element.
